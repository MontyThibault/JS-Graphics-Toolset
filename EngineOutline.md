The javascript engine for this project is outlined as follows:

A local `engine` object can be accessed within all code inside of the main wrapper. Inside of this lies all of the utilities and functions necessary for the program to work properly. `main` is called once everything has been defined; within it, the environment is initialized and the `frame` loop carries the program on, running at 60fps.`
